#Oxhack Calendar
It's a calendar system for [OxHack](http://oxhack.org).

To get started you'll want to create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) running python 3.4.3.

Then run `pip -install requirements.txt`.

To see what it's all about hop into `OxhackCalendar/OxhackCalendar` and run `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080`.

That's all there is for now. It's pretty bare bones.
